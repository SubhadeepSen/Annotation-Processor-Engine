Here we will learn:
--->how to create custom annotations [Class level(@DefineController, @DefineComponent), Field level(@AutoInject), Method level(@HandlerMethod)].
--->how to locate classes available in a particular package.
--->if any of them is annotated with proper annotation [custom annotation], we will identify them.
	
Processing:
--->Load the available classes from a particular package

--->Find all the annotated classes (@DefineController, @DefineComponent) in a given package
--->Create a Map of objects with key as class name (fully qualified name) and value as object [com.Student ---> student]

--->Scan the objects in Map and find the annotated fields (@AutoInject)
--->Inject the proper object from the Map to that particular field, if object is not present set it to null;

--->Scan the objects in Map for finding the annotated methods (@HandlerMethod)
--->If it is a proper match then check for accepted parameter(s)
--->Inject the proper parameter to that method
--->Invoke the method for execution and get the response
